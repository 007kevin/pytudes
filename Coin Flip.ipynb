    "# The Devil and the Coin Flip Game\n",
    "\n",
    ">You're playing a game with the devil, with your soul at stake. You're sitting at a circular table which has 4 coins, arranged in a diamond, at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions. We'll number those as positions 0, 1, 2, and 3, respectively. You are blindfolded, and can never see the coins or the table.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Your goal is to get all 4 coins showing heads, by telling the devil the position number(s) of some coins to flip. We call this a \"move\" on your part. The devil must faithfully perform the requested flips, but may first sneakily rotate the table any number of quarter-turns, so that the coins are in different positions. The game ends when 4 heads come up and you win; until then you  keep making moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example: You tell the devil to flip positions 0 and 2 (the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions). The devil could leave the table unrotated (or could rotate it a half-turn), and then flip the two coins that you specified. Or the devil could rotate the table a quarter turn in either direction, and then flip the coins that are now in the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock locations, which are the two other coins from the ones you specified.  You won't know which of these actions the devil took.\n",
    "\n",
    "> What is a shortest sequence of moves that is guaranteed to win, no matter what the initial state of the coins, and no matter what rotations the devil applies?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "The player, being blindfolded, does not know the true state of the coins. So the player should represent what is known: the *set of possible states* of the coins. We call this a *belief state*. At the start of the game, each of the four coins could be either heads or tails, so that's 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 possibilities in the belief state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each possible move, such as `{0, 2}`, which means \"flip the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions,\" updates the belief state as follows: for every coin sequence in the current belief state, rotate it in every possible way, and then flip the appropriate coins. Collect all these results together to form the new belief state. To solve the game, I need to come up with a sequence of moves that ends in a belief state consisting of just `{'HHHH'}`. I want it to be a shortest possible sequence, so a breadth-first search seems right. The search space will be tiny, so compute time will be trivial; the only issue is specifying the domain correctly. (To increase the chance of getting it correct, I won't try to do anything fancy, such as noticing that some sequences are rotational variants of other sequences.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Implementation Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main concepts, and my implementation choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Coins`: A *coin sequence* is represented as a `str` of four characters, such as `'HTTT'`. \n",
    "- `Belief`: A *belief state* is represented as a `frozenset` of `Coins` (frozen so that it can be hashed in a `set`).\n",
    "- `initial_belief`: The set of all possible coin sequences.\n",
    "- `rotations`: The function `rotations(coins)` returns the set of all 4 rotations of the coin sequence.\n",
    "- `update`: The function `update(belief, move)` retuns an updated belief state, representing all the possible coin sequences that could result from any devil rotation followed by the specified flip(s). (But don't flip `'HHHH'`, because the game would have already ended.)\n",
    "- `flip`: The function `flip(coins, move)` flips the specified positions within the coin sequence."
