    "# Tracking Trump: Electoral Votes Edition\n",
    "\n",
    "**[Morning Consult](https://morningconsult.com)** has a page called **[Tracking Trump](https://morningconsult.com/tracking-trump/)** that summarizes the presidential approval polls on a state-by-state basis, and summarized the number of states in which Trump currently has a net positive or net negative approval rating (that is, his current percentage of approval minus his percentage of disapproval).   But if you're thinking about the 2020 election, you don't care about the number of *states*, you care about the number of *electoral votes*. So I computed that.\n",
    "\n",
    "# TL;DR for politics nerds\n",
    "\n",
    "As of Feb 6th 2019, Trump has a net positive approval in states that total **105** electoral votes, net negative for **390** electoral votes, and tied for **43** electoral votes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania (which Trump won in 2016) are all double-digit negative now. In the key swing states of Ohio and Florida, he is -6 and -4, respectively. How is he doing in the states that border the proposed wall? Surprisingly poorly: -18 in New Mexico, -8 in Arizona, tied in Texas (which is supposed to be a Republican stronghold), and (not surprisingly), -30 in California.\n",
    "\n",
    "But of course these are just approval polls, not ballots, and don't translate directly to votes. Things can change; the election is a long ways away, we don't know who else will be on the ballot and what their approval levels will be, there might be key economic or geopolitical events, and we don't know if there is systematic bias in the polling data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, the net approval is correlated to some degree with votes. An important concept is the **swing needed** to win, that is, if we make the (unwarranted) assumption that net approval translates directly to votes, how much of a positive swing in net approval percentage across the board in all states would Truump need to get to the necessary 270?. Today he would need an **11%** swing, whereas at his inauguration date he had good approval numbers, and would have needed a 10% negative swing to slip below 270.\n",
    "\n",
    "A large swing is more likely when there are many voters who are currently undecided. So I track the number of states in which more than 5% of the poll respondants were undecided. Today there are no such states, which is evidence that most people have made up their minds. (At the inauguration all 50 states plus DC had more than 5% undecided; many people had not made up their minds then.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below summarizes the results over time. From now on I will update this when Morning Consult updates (monthly), but so far I only have results for Jan and Feb 2019, and for the Jan 2017 inauguration. \n",
