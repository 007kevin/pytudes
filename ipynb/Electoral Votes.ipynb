But if you're thinking about the 2020 election, you don't care about the number of *states*, you care about the number of *electoral votes*. Let's do some computation to figure that out."

It is a fraction because I allocate half the electoral votes for states with a net zero approval. You need **270** to win. The 126.5 number is down from 164 in Jan 2019, and 448 in Jan 2017.\n",

Things can change; the election is a long ways away, we don't know who's running, we don't know if there are third party candidate(s), and we don't know if there is systematic bias in the polling data. In the table below, I list the number of electoral votes Trump would get assuming the vote is determined by the current net approval plus a swing of between 0 and 11 percentage points across the board in every state. We see he would need an **11** percent upswing from the polling data in order to put together wore than 270 electoral votes, and a 6 point swing to exceed the total Clinton got in 2016."
