    "\n",
    "[Morning Consult](https://morningconsult.com) has a page called [Tracking Trump](https://morningconsult.com/tracking-trump/) that summarizes the presidential approval polls on a state-by-state basis, and tells you how many states Trump has a net positive or net negative approval rating. But I don't care about the number of *states*; I care about the number of *electoral votes*. This notebook computes that for me:"

We see he would need a **7** percent upswing in order to win."
