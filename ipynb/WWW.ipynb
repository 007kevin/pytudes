    "\"It's tough to make predictions, especially [about](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Yogi_Berra)  [the](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Niels_Bohr) future.\" That's true for the **NBA basketball playoffs**, where there is a wide range of opinion about the Warriors and Cavs, the teams that met in the finals each of the last three years. The Las Vegas oddsmakers  have the Warriors as co-favorites at 35% chance to win the title, while  [538](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-nba-playoffs-sleepers-favorites-and-best-first-round-matchups/), using their ELO rating, give the Warriors only a 4% chance. That 9-fold difference underscores that rational people can use different models with different assumptions and come to different conclusions.  Here are some models you might choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Holistic**: I just feel that the Warriors have about a 1/3 chance of winning it all.\n",
    "2. **Game by Game**: I think the Warriors have an 75% chance of winning each game in the first round, then 65% for each game in the second round, but only 45% against the Rockets, then 55% if they make it to the finals. From that I'll calculate their overall chance.\n",
    "3. **Point by Point**: The Warriors have a per-game average point differential of +5.8; I'll compare that to the other teams and caclulate their overall chance.\n",
    "4. **Play by Play**: Use [detailed statistics](https://www.basketball-reference.com/play-index/plus/shot_finder.cgi) to [model](https://danvatterott.com/blog/2016/06/16/creating-videos-of-nba-action-with-sportsvu-data/) the game shot-by-shot, or even pass-by-pass.
