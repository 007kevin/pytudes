    "# Twelve Balls and a Balance Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "> *You are given twelve identical-looking balls and a two-sided scale. One of the balls is of a different weight, although you don't know whether it's lighter or heavier. How can you use just three weighings of the scale to determine not only what the different ball is, but also whether it's lighter or heavier?*\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a traditional brain-teaser puzzle, meant to be solved with paper and pencil. \n",
    "But I want to not just solve this specific puzzle, but show how to write a program that can solve related puzzles where you can vary (a) the number of balls, (b) the number of weighings allowed, and (c) whether the odd ball might be heavier, lighter, or either. (I originally solved this in 2012, but am republishing it here in revised form because the problem was mentioned in the [538 Riddler](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/which-billiard-ball-is-rigged/) for 16 August 2019.)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the concepts I'm dealing with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **balls**: In the general case I have N balls; for example I'll represent N = 3 balls with `[1, 2, 3]`.\n",
    "- **oddballs**: Exactly one of the balls is **odd** in its weight; if ball N is heavier, I'll represent that as +N; if it is lighter, as -N. With N = 3, I will represent the collection of possible oddballs as `[+1, -1, +2, -2, +3]`.\n",
    "- **puzzle**: A specific puzzle declares the number of balls, the maximum number of weighings allowed, and the oddballs. \n",
    "- **weighing**: I can weigh a collection of balls on the left versus a collection on the right, and the result (given that we know the oddball) will be that the left side is greater than, equal to, or less than the right in weight.\n",
    "I'll denote that with the call `weigh(L, R, oddball)`, which returns a string, `'gt'`, `'eq'`, or `'lt'`.\n",
    "- **weight**: I'll arbitrarily say that a normal ball weighs 100, a lighter ball 99, and a heavier ball 101.\n",
    "- **solution**: A particular puzzle states the number of balls, the number of weighings allowed, and whether the odd ball can be lighter, heavier, or either. For example, the original puzzle is solved with a call to `solve(12, 3, {+1, -1})`. The solution is a **strategy tree**.\n",
    "- **strategy tree**: a tree where each node is either a leaf node consisting of an *oddball* integer, or is an interior node with 5 components: the balls to be placed on the left and right side of the scale, and a subtree for each of the three possible outcomes: `'gt'`, `'eq'`, or `'lt'`. The constructor `Tree(L, R, gt, eq, lt)` creates a tree, where `L` and `R` are collections of balls, and `gt`, `eq`, and `lt` are trees.\n",
    "- **following a path in a tree**: I'll use `follow(tree, oddball)` to say \"follow the path through the tree, at each weighing assuming the given oddball, and return the leaf node reached&mdash;the oddball that the tree predicts.\n",
    "- **valid tree**: a tree is a valid solution if no branch uses more than the allowable number of weighings, and if, for every possible oddball, following the path through the tree gives the correct oddball as the answer. We'll delay the discussion of how to find a valid tree until later.\n",
