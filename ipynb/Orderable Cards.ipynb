    "> *You play so many card games that you’ve developed a very specific organizational obsession. When you’re dealt your hand, you want to organize it such that the cards of a given suit are grouped together and, if possible, such that no suited groups of the same color are adjacent. (Numbers don’t matter to you.) Moreover, when you receive your randomly ordered hand, you want to achieve this organization with a single motion, moving only one adjacent block of cards to some other position in your hand, maintaining the original order of that block and other cards, except for that one move.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Suppose you’re playing pitch, in which a hand has six cards. What are the odds that you can accomplish your obsessive goal? What about for another game, where a hand has N cards, somewhere between 1 and 13?*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to decide is how many `N`-card hands are there? That will tell if I can just use brute force.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is (52 choose `N`), and (52 choose 6) is 20,358,520. So it is barely feasible to use brute force there. But I notice that the problem states *\"Numbers don’t matter,\"* so I can just consider the *suits* of the cards. Then there are only 4<sup>`N`</sup> hands, which is a mere 4,096 for `N` = 6, and a barely feasible 67,108,864 for `N` = 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Deals: Hands and their Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two red suits and two black suits, so I'll represent the four suits with the characters `'rbRB'`. (I also considered using `'♠️♥️♦️♣️'`.) I'll represent a hand as a string of suits: `'rrBrbr'` is a 6-card hand. I'll define `deals(N)` to return a dict of all possible hands of length `N`, each mapped to the probability of the hand. I'll use exact `Fraction` arithmetic. I'll use `lru_cache` when there are expensive computations that I don't want to repeat."

What's the most number of runs that can be reduced by a singe move? One run could be reduced when we remove  block, if the cards on either side of the block are the same. When we replace the block, we can reduce 2 more, if the left and right ends of the block match the cards to the left and right of the new position. So that makes 3.
