    "# Properly Ordered Card Hands\n",
    "\n",
    "The 538 Riddler [presented](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/who-will-capture-the-most-james-bonds/) this problem by Matt Ginsberg:\n",
    "    \n",
    "> *You play so many card games that you’ve developed a very specific organizational obsession. When you’re dealt your hand, you want to organize it such that the cards of a given suit are grouped together and, if possible, such that no suited groups of the same color are adjacent. (Numbers don’t matter to you.) Moreover, when you receive your randomly ordered hand, you want to achieve this organization with a single motion, moving only one adjacent block of cards to some other position in your hand, maintaining the original order of that block and other cards, except for that one move.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Suppose you’re playing pitch, in which a hand has six cards. What are the odds that you can accomplish your obsessive goal? What about for another game, where a hand has N cards, somewhere between 1 and 13?*\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to decide is how many `N`-card hands are there? That will tell if I can just use brute force, looking at every possible hand. The answer is (52 choose `N`), so we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6 cards: 20,358,520 hands\n",
    "- 13 cards: 635,013,559,600 hands \n",
    "\n",
    "That's too many hands. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Abstract Hands\n",
    "\n",
    "I notice that the problem states *\"Numbers don’t matter,\"* so I can abstract away from *cards* to *suits*: instead of saying that the first card in this hand is the seven of spades, I can just say it is a spade. Then there are only 4<sup>N</sup> abstract hands (for N &le; 13), so we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 6 cards: 4,096 abstract hands\n",
    "- 13 cards: 67,108,864 abstract hands\n",

    "That's a big improvement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "# Deals: Hands and their Probabilities\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two red suits and two black suits, so I'll represent the four suits with the characters `'rbRB'`. (I also considered using `'♠️♥️♦️♣️'`.) I'll represent an abstract hand as a string of suits: `'rrBrbr'` is a 6-card hand. I'll define `deals(N)` to return a dict of all possible abstract hands of length `N`, each mapped to the probability of the hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "With actual hands, every hand has the same probability, because every card is equally likely to be the next card dealt. But with abstract hands, the probability of the next suit depends on how many cards of that suit have already been dealt. If I've already dealt the 12 cards `'rrrrrrrrrrrr'`, then the probability of the next card being an `'r'` is 1/40, and the probability of it being a `'b'` is 13/40. So as I build up the abstract hands, I'll need to keep track of the number of remaining cards of each suit.\n",

    "I'll use `Fraction` to get exact arithmetic and `lru_cache` to avoid repeated computations."
