    "# The Devil and the Coin Flip Game\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Devil ever challenges me to a [fiddle contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Devil_Went_Down_to_Georgia), I'm going down. But I heard about a contest where I'd have a better chance:\n",
    "\n",
    "> *You're playing a game with the devil, with your soul at stake. You're sitting at a circular table which has 4 coins, arranged in a diamond, at the 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions. You are blindfolded, and can never see the coins or the table.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Your goal is to get all 4 coins showing heads, by telling the devil the position(s) of some coins to flip. We call this a \"move\" on your part. The devil must faithfully perform the requested flips, but may first sneakily rotate the table any number of quarter-turns, so that the coins are in different positions. You keep making moves, and the devil keeps rotating and flipping, until all 4 coins show heads.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Example: You tell the devil the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions. The devil could leave the table unrotated (or could rotate it a half-turn), and then flip the two coins that you specified. Or the devil could rotate the table a quarter turn in either direction, and then flip the coins that are now in the 12 o'clock and 6 o'clock positions (which were formerly at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock).  You won't know which of these actions the devil took.*\n",
    "\n",
    "> *What is a shortest sequence of moves that is *guaranteed* to win, no matter what the initial state of the coins, and no matter what rotations the devil applies?*\n",
    "\n",
    "# Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- We're looking for a \"shortest sequence of moves\" that reaches a goal. That's a [shortest path search problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem). I've done that before.\n",
    "- Since the Devil gets to make moves too, you might think that this is a [minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) problem: that we should choose the move that leads to the shortest path, given that the Devil has the option of making moves that lead to the longest path.\n",
    "- In fact, the Devil would do well to determine his best move using a minimax search.\n",
    "- However, the player can't do that, because minimax only works when you know what moves the opponent is making. Here the player is blinfolded; that makes it a [partially observable problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_observable_system) (in this case, not observable at all, but we still say \"partially\").\n",
    "- In such problems, we don't know for sure the true state of the world before or after any move. So we should represent what *is* known: *the set of states that we believe to be possible*. We call this a *belief state*. At the start of the game, each of the four coins could be either heads or tails, so that's 2<sup>4</sup> = 16 possibilities in the belief state:\n",
    "       {HHHH, HHHT, HHTH, HHTT, HTHH, HTHT, HTTH, HTTT, \n",
    "        THHH, THHT, THTH, THTT, TTHH, TTHT, TTTH, TTTT}\n",
    "- So we have a single-agent shortest path search in the space of belief states (not the space of physical states of the coins). We search for a path from the inital belief state to the goal belief state, which is `{HHHH}`.\n",
    "- A move updates the belief state as follows: for every four-coin sequence in the current belief state, rotate it in every possible way, and then flip the coins specified by the position(s) in the move. Collect all these results together to form the new belief state. The search space is small (just 2<sup>16</sup> possible belief states), so run time will be fast; the only issue is specifying the domain correctly. \n",
    "- To increase the chance of getting it right, I won't do anything fancy, such as noticing rotational symmetry  (although we'll come back to that later).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Vocabulary and  Implementation Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Coins`: a *coin sequence* (on the table) is represented as a `str` of four characters, such as `'HTTT'`. \n",
    "- `Belief`: a *belief state* is represented as a `frozenset` of `Coins` (frozen so that it can be hashed).\n",
    "- `Position`: an integer index into the coin sequence; position `0` selects the `H` in `'HTTT'`\n",
    "and corresponds to the 12 o'clock position; position 1 corresponds to 3 o'clock, and so on.\n",
    "- `Move`: a set of positions to flip, such as `{0, 2}`. \n",
    "- `Strategy`: an ordered list of moves. Since there is no feedback while playing\n",
    "(blindfolded) there are no  decision points in the strategy. \n",
    "- `winning(strategy)`: a winning strategy is one that takes us from the initial state to the goal, regardless\n",
    "of what rotations the Devil chooses.\n",
    "- `all_moves()`: returns a list of every possible move a player can make.\n",
    "- `all_coins()`: returns a belief state consisting of the set of all 16 possible coin sequences: `{'HHHH', 'HHHT', ...}`.\n",
    "- `rotations(coins)`: returns a set of all 4 rotations of the coin sequence.\n",
    "- `flip(coins, move)`: flips the specified positions within the coin sequence.\n",
    " (But don't flip `'HHHH'`, because the game would have already ended if this were the coin sequence.)\n",
    "- `update(belief, move)`: returns an updated belief state: all the coin sequences that could result from any rotation followed by the specified flips.\n"
