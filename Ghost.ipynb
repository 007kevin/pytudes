    "- **Security:** A strategy function could *cheat*, and modify  `vocab.words`, inserting or deleting some crucial words to ensure victory. Can you harden `play` (and/or change `Vocabulary`) to protect against that?\n",
    "- **Saving Space:** Currently `Vocabulary` saves words and fragments that could never be reached in a game. For example, because `'the'` is a word that ends the game, we could never reach `'them'` or `'theme'` or `'thermoluminescences'`. Can you eliminate these redundant words/fragments?\n",
    "- **Multi-player:** `play(enable1, ask('A'), ask('B'), ask('C'))` will play a three-player game. But `rational` (along with `win` and `winner`) would no longer work, since they assume there are exactly two players. Can you alter them to allow *n* players?\n",
    "- **SuperGhost Summary:** Can you summarize a SuperGhost strategy in a way that a human can memorize?\n",
    "- **Xghost:** In *Xghost*, a letter can be added anywhere, so from the fragment `'ab'` you could play `'arb'`.\n",
    "- **Spook:** In *Spook*, letters can be rearranged before adding one, so from the fragment `'ab'` you could play `'bxa'`."
